sum_ = "In 1898, Lt. Colonel John Henry Patterson is hired to construct a railway bridge in Tsavo, Kenya. However, the project is hindered by a pair of man-eating lions that target the workers. After initial attempts to kill the lions fail, famous hunter Charles Remington is called in to help. Despite their efforts, the lions continue to terrorize the camp, killing Remington in the process. Patterson eventually kills both lions, the bridge is completed, and he returns to his family."
